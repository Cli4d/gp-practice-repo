### John Mwangi

John Mwangi is a mobile developer from Kenya who works at an edtech company that provides online learning and assessment platforms for students and teachers. He uses .NET to create native and cross-platform mobile apps that deliver engaging and interactive learning experiences and feedback.

John Mwangi says that .NET has made his life easier and more productive by allowing him to use the same language, tools, and code base to target multiple platforms and devices, such as Android, iOS, and Windows. He also loves the fact that he can use .NET to leverage the latest technologies and trends, such as cloud, IoT, and AR/VR.

John Mwangi's vision is to use his skills and creativity to transform education and learning in Africa. He is currently working on a project that uses .NET and Xamarin to create a gamified and personalized learning app that adapts to the learner's level, preferences, and goals. He hopes that his project will help to increase access and quality of education in his continent.
